# Objective: Build a TypeScript server for web scraping with Playwright and LLM

- [x] Setup Node.js project with TypeScript
- [x] Install dependencies (Playwright, Express, LLM client, dotenv)
- [x] Define project structure
- [x] Create type definitions (`types.ts`)
- [x] Implement LLM interaction module (`llm.ts`) - _Initial placeholder_
- [x] Implement Playwright scraping logic (`scraper.ts`) - _Initial structure_
- [x] Implement Express server (`server.ts`) - _Basic setup_
- [x] Define API endpoint (`/scrape`)
- [x] Implement core scraping loop (fetch, analyze, navigate) - _Partially done in scraper.ts_
- [x] Implement LLM logic for information extraction and formatting - _Placeholder prompt in llm.ts_
- [x] Implement LLM logic for deciding next action (click) - _Placeholder prompt in llm.ts_
- [x] Add error handling - _Basic handling added_
- [x] Add max steps limit - _Implemented in scraper.ts_
- [x] Add user-defined schema handling - _Passed to LLM, needs prompt refinement_
- [ ] Refine prompts and logic
- [x] Add basic README
- [x] Create .gitignore file
- [ ] SQLLITE DB storage of requests
- [ ] basic auth, and token based requests
- [ ] rate limiting
- [ ] admin access page
- [ ] admin approve user
- [ ] admin view request history
- [ ] UI based scraping page with csv format export
- [ ] api streaming back current steps
- [] a version where the page only takes input query and sight and the first prompt it to detrmin the schema then the api is fed with the schema and the rest works the same
