# Objective: Build a TypeScript server for web scraping with Playwright and LLM

- [x] Setup Node.js project with TypeScript
- [x] Install dependencies (Playwright, Express, LLM client, dotenv)
- [x] Define project structure
- [x] Create type definitions (`types.ts`)
- [x] Implement LLM interaction module (`llm.ts`) - _Initial placeholder_
- [x] Implement Playwright scraping logic (`scraper.ts`) - _Initial structure_
- [x] Implement Express server (`server.ts`) - _Basic setup_
- [x] Define API endpoint (`/scrape`)
- [x] Implement core scraping loop (fetch, analyze, navigate) - _Partially done in scraper.ts_
- [x] Implement LLM logic for information extraction and formatting - _Placeholder prompt in llm.ts_
- [x] Implement LLM logic for deciding next action (click) - _Placeholder prompt in llm.ts_
- [x] Add error handling - _Basic handling added_
- [x] Add max steps limit - _Implemented in scraper.ts_
- [x] Add user-defined schema handling - _Passed to LLM, needs prompt refinement_
- [x] Refine prompts and logic
- [x] Add basic README
- [x] Create .gitignore file
- [x] Database storage of requests
- [x] basic auth, and token based requests _(Models and endpoints added)_
- [x] rate limiting _(Added using express-rate-limit)_
- [x] admin access page _(Created admin.html and /admin route)_
- [x] admin approve user _(Endpoint exists)_
- [x] admin view request history _(Endpoint and UI added)_
- [x] UI based scraping page with csv format export _(Created scrape.html with CSV export)_
- [x] docker build error in prod Error: ENOENT: no such file or directory, stat '/app/dist/static/index.html' _(Fixed with proper static file handling)_
- [x] better https error response for scrape api _(Added proper error handling)_
- [x] add a text prompt to llm from the api request _(Added prompt support in interface and scraper)_
- [x] change port to 6061 by default or port given in .env
